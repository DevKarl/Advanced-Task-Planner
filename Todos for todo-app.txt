Next up:

.Add trash bin opening animation on hover 
.Add edit-todo functionality
. Add sorting functionality (ascending, descending and default) --> based on index as timestamp
. Add clear-all button (deletes all todos)
. Fix mobile responsiveness (3 dots with small windwow-popup(maybe modal))
. Improve guard clauses (many spaces or too long todo) --> add modal window error message (use react portal)
. Once user starts typing inside of input field --> make new button popup next to add: "more" where...
    - user can add priority level (exclamation mark-value from 1 to 3 --> icons lighting up functionality)
    - user can add due date (read up on JS-date features)
        if due date is in less than 3 days --> add orange label with due-date warning tag
        if due date is in 1 day -->  add red label with due date in one day
. add progress bar that fills up (percentage of completed tasks)
. make sure there are no bugs in local storage (annoying async hell with timeout)
. improve button animations: don't use scale on all of them(add modern hover effects)
. in future: use Firebase or store todos in backend instead of local storage ? 
. Run react-testing library?

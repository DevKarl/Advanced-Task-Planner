# Advanced Task Planner

First Personal React Project - CURRENTLY IN WORK 👨🏼‍💻🔧!

The basic stuff - tasks can be:
- added
- edited
- checked off
- deleted 
- stored in local storage

More advanced:
- tasks be filtered based on multiple options
- tasks have optional urgency level with dynamic badges(!, !! or !!!)
- tasks have optional deadline displayed with dynamic coloring (in 3 days: orange, tomorrow: red color)
- progress bar filling up
- easter-egg-like feature(non explicit): emoji button with text on hover "activate/deactive automatic emojies"

Poential challenges for later
- add seach bar to search after todos? (with preditice search🤯?)
- remove local storage - try using database/backend and connect with API instead?
- implement typescript or next.js for SSR for certain parts(overkill?)


Key takeaways - react concepts, architecture etc:
- Reusable components (modal, UI (card, btns) etc.)
- Error boundary 
- Memoization 



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

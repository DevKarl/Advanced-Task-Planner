ON DESKTOP:

. add progress bar that fills up (percentage of completed tasks)
. improve button animations: don't use scale on all of them(add modern hover effects)
. CHALLENGE: add settings-wheel with modal where user can cutomize todo colors, what more
. Refactor notes:
    - check if two way bindings are implemented correctly (value and onChange)
    - naming convention.. rename everything to somethingHandler from handleSomething
. Fix textarea input for modal window?

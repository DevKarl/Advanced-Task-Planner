.In settings modal: add toggle for progress bar
.Add tags for tasks + filter option for the tags where tags show up as filter options
    - filter options: 
.Deactive sort btn, clear all tasks btn if there are no tasks, same with filter btn, remove modal error for these
.Fix background colors on all colors except blue, make it less dark and fix yellow color
.Refactoring:
    - make sure handlers have same naming-convention (handlerSomething or somethingHandler)
    - fix task actions buttons animation, not depending on click duration, give it fixed duration on click 
    - disable buttons on sort and delete all, if the tasks arr is empty and remove errors for this
    - don't throw errors from helper functions, make them return booleans instead and throw from components
    - Make a decision: ref(direct DOM manipulation) or state (re-renders but no direct DOM-manipulation) for task input and editTask
    - Remove !important everywhere in CSS media queries for modal

    - make sure handlers have same naming-convention (handlerSomething or somethingHandler)
    - fix task actions buttons animation, not depending on click duration, give it fixed duration on click 
    - disable buttons on sort and delete all, if the tasks arr is empty and remove errors for this
    - don't throw errors from helper functions, make them return booleans instead and throw from components
    - Make a decision: ref(direct DOM manipulation) or state (re-renders but no direct DOM-manipulation) for task input and editTask
